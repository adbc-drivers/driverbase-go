# Go Framework for Apache Arrow ADBC Drivers

This is a framework for developing ADBC drivers in Go.  It is forked from the
(internal and hence inaccessible) framework upstream in
[apache/arrow-adbc](https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc/).

`driverbase` contains the framework.  `testutil` contains some common helpers
for writing unit tests.
